Notes from Saul
---------------
I was thinking of some stuff about the way that the OSS community is producing a huge number of new tools for software development and those tools are being used to make the software development process more effective (a virtuous cycle).

So we build on the Stallman era of emacs being OSS start getting CI servers, automated testing tool (ahem!) and even stuff for fast prototyping like Twitter Bootstrap and frameworks like Backbone.js

That was what was in my head, but you should take it anyway that you see fit.
